# Introduction
This repository houses the ClimateWins Machine Learning Project, a student-led initiative under the CareerFoundry data science program. The project aims to apply machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the impact of climate change on weather patterns across Europe. Through this academic endeavor, we explore the potential of machine learning in enhancing our understanding of how climate variability and extreme weather events can be forecasted using historical data.

The core objectives of this project include:

Applying supervised and unsupervised learning models to discern patterns and predict future climatic phenomena.
Exploring data from extensive historical weather datasets to understand trends and prepare more accurate predictive models.
Evaluating the effectiveness of different machine learning strategies in the context of meteorological data.
This project is a simulation designed for educational purposes, providing practical experience in handling real-world data within an academic framework.
